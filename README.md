# DataStructuresAndAnalysis-CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem being solved for the projects were being able to assess the amount of time it took to organize data based on the data structure that we were revieiwng for the class. During this time, we were given a scenario in which we are helping a Uninversity organize their classes in Alphanumerical order and which data structure would be able to accomodate the needs of the client. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I started with the requirements as set by the client. After assessing their needs and their types of data, I chose the best solution possible for them and in this case, I chose the Binary Search Trees as the best data structure for their needs. Data structures are important to understand because each data structure and the way it is built may have different search and access times depending on the type of data that will be put into it. Any programming that is done, we want it to be efficient as possible and with that, is assessing the search times with the types of data. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Any roadblocks encountered, I would generally search online for other guides for help with my paticular issue. Data structures at some points can be complicated in the programming process so being able to look up others' work and being able to read for a better understanding was helpful. Zybooks was great as a guide, but because they use very simple scenarios in the reading, looking up data structure coding online in more complicated scenarios was helpful. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
In a previous course, for one of my discussions I had originally mentioned wanting to learn more about data structures in terms of how some data is stored or at least read in files. I was able to expand my knowledge on the topic in this course on the matter and have a better understanding of what needs to be pre-determined in the software development process. I believe I saw somewhere in the course that we generally don't have to create data structures from scratch anymore but I believe being able to understand how the different structures work will still affect the development of software in general and should be considered an important item for consideration at the beginning of a project. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project has made me use comments much more than I'm used to having to write. Since there may be many parts to the data structure and many different functions for that process, I had to make sure I kept them straight and had to use comments much more to refer back to other areas after I debugged and made changes to assure everything was flowing and functional.
